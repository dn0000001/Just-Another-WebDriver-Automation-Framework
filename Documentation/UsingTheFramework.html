<p>
    Using the Framework:
</p>
<p>
    1. Create a new class (<strong>com.automation.ui.common.sampleProject.tests.LoginTest</strong>) to hold your test which extends <strong>com.automation.ui.common.utilities.Controller</strong>. 
The <strong>com.automation.ui.common.utilities.Controller</strong> class uses
    TestNG to perform setup &amp; tear down of the test. The initialization method readies the environmental variables such as URL for the test and timeouts.
    The quitBrowser method closes the browser(s) and takes a screenshot(s) as necessary.
</p>
<p>
    a. Add a method (<strong>runLoginPositiveFlow</strong>) for the test. Add the annotation @Test which indicates to TestNG that this is a test.
</p>
<p>
    b. Override the initialization method to read the location of the data file from the config.xml file. Also, it should update the translations if any are
    needed by the test.
</p>
<p>
    c. Update the config.xml file with the location to the data file for the test.
</p>
<p>
    d. Create the TestNG xml file for the test. (This is the file that TestNG uses to know which tests to execute.)
</p>
<p>
    e. Add a method (<strong>dataForLogin</strong>) to be the data provider in your test class (<strong>com.automation.ui.common.sampleProject.tests.LoginTest</strong>). 
Add the annotation @DataProvider which
    indicates to TestNG that this provides the data to the test. The recommended technique is to store the test data in an XML file. To support this, there is
    the VTD_XML class to provide a simple generic way to read XML files using xpath. (There are a few classes to also read data from Excel, CSV or even a
    database.)
</p>
<p>
    2. Create a new class (<strong>com.automation.ui.common.sampleProject.dataStructures.TestContext</strong>) to hold all the data for your test. It is recommended 
to use a single class or a few classes at most to
    make it easier to maintain and refactor the code. This class needs to contain (or extend) the BasicTestContext class. The BasicTestContext class contains
    the basic variables needed for every test such as a WebDriver variable, the test URL, timeouts, etc.
</p>
<p>
    a. Update the test method (<strong>runLoginPositiveFlow</strong>) to have parameters for the Test ID and Test Data 
(<strong>com.automation.ui.common.sampleProject.dataStructures.TestContext</strong>). The Test ID is used to
    find the test results in the logs.
</p>
<p>
    b. Add the logging of the Test ID to the start &amp; end of the test using the methods <em>writeTestIDtoLog</em> &amp; <em>writeTestSuccessToLog</em>.
</p>
<p>
    3. Create a new class (<strong>com.automation.ui.common.sampleProject.pages.Login</strong>) which extends <strong>com.automation.ui.common.utilities.Framework</strong> 
that will provide methods to work on a specific page to be
    automated. This class is called a page object. The <strong>com.automation.ui.common.utilities.Framework</strong> class is a wrapper class that contains methods to work with Selenium
    (WebDriver) without needing an extensive knowledge of the tool. (Also, it would be possible to change the tool to something else by simply implementing the
    same methods in the new tool.)
</p>
<p>
    a. Add all the necessary methods to the page object (<strong>com.automation.ui.common.sampleProject.pages.Login</strong>) to automation one or more test steps. Each method should be designed to
    work regardless of the data instead of specific hard coded values. Add the data objects to the main data class (<strong>com.automation.ui.common.sampleProject.dataStructures.TestContext</strong>) in an organized
    structure for easy maintenance and refactoring.
</p>
<p>
    4. Use the page object (<strong>com.automation.ui.common.sampleProject.pages.Login</strong>) in the test method (<strong>runLoginPositiveFlow</strong>) to automate one or more steps.
</p>
<p>
    a. Update the data provider (<strong>dataForLogin</strong>) to read the data needed for the page object (<strong>com.automation.ui.common.sampleProject.pages.Login</strong>) to allow for unit testing.
</p>
<p>
    5. Repeat creating page objects to automation one or more steps and integrating into the test (<strong>runLoginPositiveFlow</strong>) &amp; unit testing. It is
    recommended that you use Test Driven Design to automate the test by writing high-level comments in the test (<strong>runLoginPositiveFlow</strong>) first. Then, writing
    the code / page objects to perform the actions.
